# GE-Synchrony-Credit-Model / a Capstone project
Abstract
This paper will draft an enterprise strategy for Synchrony that creates business value from existing data sources. Included is an executive presentation of the summary of the analytic plan, the results of the initial pilot and final analysis, and an explanation of the value this plan will add to the organization. CRISP-DM methodology was used to articulate the business problem and then RStudio to analyze the data and create a predictor model based on attributes identified as bad credit risk applicants. 

The data was comprised of categorical and numeric data. There were 1,000 rows, 27 variables or attributes, and 27,000 observations.
